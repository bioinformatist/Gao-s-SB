# Dr.***Gao's*** <i>**S**</i>trange requirement oriented tool <i>***B***</i>ox (**Gao's SB**)
A toolbox for bioinformatics works in Dr. Gao's lab.

## Requirements: 
- None
- But currently only for Windows user

## Features:
This application has the following features:
- GenerateÂ a file containing alignments in format for (could be, but not limited to) supplementary files of publication.

## Contributor:
- [Yu Sun](http://icannotendure.space/)

## Known issues:
- Since *MagicBlast* has been chosen as aligner, the boundary of the alignment may not as accurate as you think. 
It also can occur at `-` (a placeholder representing a base length, known as a deletion in query). 
You **should** check and modify the results yourself. 
However, the program still saves you a lot of time.
- I won't provide a archive of one-file bundle for some time to come.

## TODO
- Handle with error
- New feature: Get sequences with specific region from NCBI databases.
