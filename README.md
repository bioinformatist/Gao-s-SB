# Dr.***Gao's*** <i>**S**</i>trange requirement oriented tool <i>***B***</i>ox (**Gao's SB**)
A toolbox for bioinformatics works in Dr. Gao's lab.

## Requirements: 
- None
- But currently only for Windows user

## Features:
This application has the following features:
- Batch align queries to a single reference, and generate a file containing alignments in format for (could be, but not limited to) supplementary files of publication.
- Batch download sequence by *accession number* as specific base location.

## Known issues:
- Since *MagicBlast* has been chosen as aligner, the boundaries of alignments may not as accurate as you think. 
It also can occur at `-` (a placeholder representing a base length, known as a deletion in query). 
You **should** check and modify the results yourself. 
**However, the program still saves you a lot of time.**
- I won't provide a archive of one-file bundle for some time to come.

## Examples:
### 1. Align queries to subject(single-sequence reference)
You may perform as follow picture:
![example_how_align_queries.png](docs/imgs/example_how_align_queries.png)

The result of this tool seems like:
![example_result_align_queries.png](docs/imgs/example_result_align_queries.png)

(a) The file was opened in *notepad++*. Alignments were shown as in-line "fasta" format.

(b) The boundaries (softclip ending) of alignments were added parentheses for distinction.
**Warning: It may not accurate here, and correction by hands may needed.**

(c) The **insertion** (queries according to the subject) will be **deleted** and the **deletion** will be shown as `-`.
**Warning: It may also not accurate near *deletion*, and correction by hands may needed.**

### 2. Batch download sequence (could be specified base location)
You may perform as follow picture:
![example_how_download_seq.png](docs/imgs/example_how_download_seq.png)

The result of this tool seems like:

## Installation
The `zip` file currently hosted on [releases page](https://github.com/bioinformatist/Gao-s-SB/releases) of this repo. Just unzip it then find `exe` file for using.

## TODO:
- Handle with error.
- ~~New feature: Get sequences with specific region from NCBI databases.~~
- Add logo.
- Add icon.
- Add warnings and other dialog widgets.
- Perform UPX compression on certain dependencies for binary release.
